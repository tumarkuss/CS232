1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?

  cmpl $6,-4(%ebp)-----> This is the if statement declaration.

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
Despite the if statement it will never jump and skip movl $15,-8(%ebp)
Which overwrites value of the integer b from 5 to 15.


3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle”? Why or why not?

"Jg" is jump if >=

"jle" is jump if <

So we cannot just rewrite them. Because there will be a logical error. We will have to change the values stored as well and if instruction works with a "pivoting" point we will have to increment the value by 1.
