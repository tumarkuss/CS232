1.What instruction is “int a, b, c, d;” converted to? 

	pushl %ebp
        movl %esp,%ebp

	subl $16,%esp	----------------
        movl $1,-4(%ebp)                |
        movl $2,-8(%ebp)                |--This part allocates 4 ints(a, b, c, d). 
        movl $3,-12(%ebp)               |  
        movl $4,-16(%ebp)---------------
	
	leave
        ret

2.Does “int a, b, c, d;” shrink or grow the stack? How many bytes are allocated on stack for a, b, c, and d? Explain them using instruction from question 1.
	
	It increases the stack and creates space for 4 ints(16 bytes). So %esp moves down(grows) by 16 spaces. Then it fills up those addresses with the values given, 4 spaces apart.

3.What instruction is “b=2;” converted to? How is the address of variable b formed in the instruction?

 movl $2,-8(%ebp)----Instruction for "b=2"

 This instruction gives value of 2($2) and allocates that 4 spaces after %ebp register.

4.Based on the instructions converted from four assignments, can we claim the declaration order determines the allocation order? For instance, a is declared before b, does it mean a is to be allocated before b on stack? Verify your theory by changing the declaration to “int a, c, b, d;”

Yes, declaration order determines the allocation order. But value assignment doesn't affect the allocation order. 

int main(){
    int a = 2;
    int b = 4;
}

Is:

	subl $8,%esp
        movl $2,-4(%ebp)
        movl $4,-8(%ebp)


AND
	int b, a;
    	a = 2;
    	b = 4;

	subl $8,%esp
        movl $2,-8(%ebp)
        movl $4,-4(%ebp)


So when I declare the first int, compiler goes and allocates space for it. And no matter when I assign a value to the int. It will always keep the space for it in the beginning of the stack frame.
